## TL;DR

```bash
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add LigphiDonk/Oh-my--paper
/plugin install omp@oh-my-paper
```

Restart Claude Code. Run `/omp:setup` inside your research project, then drive the full pipeline with `/omp:survey`, `/omp:experiment`, and `/omp:write`. No GUI, no window-switching — everything in the terminal.

## Why This Exists

Claude Code is already a great coding agent. But **research isn't just coding** — it's literature survey, idea evaluation, experiment design, paper writing, reference checking, and a dozen other things that require domain-specific workflows.

Oh My Paper makes Claude Code **research-aware** by adding:

- **A structured 5-stage pipeline** — Survey → Ideation → Experiment → Publication → Promotion
- **5 specialized agent roles** — each with isolated memory and clear responsibilities
- **34 built-in research skills** — from paper search to figure generation
- **Background hooks** — auto-inject project context at session start, prompt role selection, track task completion
- **Codex delegation** — hand off parallel tasks to Codex in a separate terminal

Install it and forget about it. Your sessions get smarter. Your research gets organized.

## Install

### Step 1: Add the marketplace

```bash
/plugin marketplace add LigphiDonk/Oh-my--paper
```

### Step 2: Install the plugin

```bash
/plugin install omp@oh-my-paper
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Code

Required for hooks to activate.

### Step 4: Initialize your project

```bash
/omp:setup
```

This scaffolds the `.pipeline/` directory and registers the `SessionStart` hook for your project.

### Update

Keep the plugin up to date with one command:

```bash
/omp:update
```

Options:
- `--check-only` - Only check for updates without installing
- `--auto` - Auto-update without confirmation

The plugin also checks for updates automatically once per day when you start a session (if auto-check is enabled).

If a new version is available:
1. The update command downloads the latest code from GitHub
2. Copies it to the plugin cache directory
3. Prompts you to run `/reload-plugins` (and restart if hooks changed)

> **Manual update (fallback)**:
> If automatic update fails, you can manually update:
> ```bash
> /plugin uninstall omp
> /plugin install omp@oh-my-paper
> /reload-plugins
> ```

### Install from Local Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LigphiDonk/Oh-my--paper.git /tmp/oh-my-paper
# In Claude Code:
/plugin marketplace add /tmp/oh-my-paper
/plugin install omp@oh-my-paper
```

## Slash Commands

All commands are prefixed with `/omp:`.

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/omp:setup` | Scaffold a new research project — creates `.pipeline/`, memory files, and registers the SessionStart hook |
| `/omp:survey` | AI-assisted literature survey — search papers, build `literature_bank.md` |
| `/omp:ideate` | Generate and evaluate research ideas based on survey findings |
| `/omp:experiment` | Design experiments, write evaluation code, run on remote compute nodes |
| `/omp:mega` | 25-stage research pipeline with auto-pilot mode — full workflow from ideation to publication |
| `/omp:write` | Draft paper sections, generate figures and captions, manage LaTeX files |
| `/omp:review` | Peer-review your paper or experiment results before submission |
| `/omp:debate` | Multi-agent debate (Proponent/Opponent/Synthesizer) to validate research hypotheses |
| `/omp:progress` | Visualize research progress with ASCII progress bars (Legacy + Mega modes) |
| `/omp:plan` | Review global progress, confirm next steps, update research plan |
| `/omp:export` | Export final paper to PDF with proper formatting for submission |
| `/omp:update` | One-click plugin update — check for and install the latest version from GitHub |
| `/omp:recover` | Recover project state from a snapshot (auto-saved before key operations) |
| `/omp:tutorial` | Interactive tutorial — walk through the full OMP workflow with a simulated project |

### Quick Start

```bash
/omp:setup          # scaffold the project
/omp:survey         # start literature survey
/omp:ideate         # generate ideas from survey
/omp:experiment     # design & run experiments
/omp:write          # draft the paper
/omp:review         # final quality gate
```

## The Agent Team

When you open Claude Code in an Oh My Paper project, the `SessionStart` hook fires and Claude immediately asks which role you want to take on. Each role has **isolated memory** — it only reads and writes the files it needs.

| Role | Responsibility | Memory Scope |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Conductor** | Global planning, review outputs, dispatch tasks, auto-update `project_truth` after each subtask | `project_truth` · `orchestrator_state` · `tasks.json` · `review_log` · `agent_handoff` · `decision_log` |
| **Literature Scout** | Search papers, organize literature bank | `project_truth` · `execution_context` · `literature_bank` · `decision_log` |
| **Experiment Driver** | Design experiments, write code, run evaluations | `execution_context` · `experiment_ledger` · `research_brief.json` · `project_truth` |
| **Paper Writer** | Draft sections, generate figures, audit references | `execution_context` · `result_summary` · `literature_bank` · `agent_handoff` |
| **Reviewer** | Peer review, quality gate, consistency check | `execution_context` · `project_truth` · `result_summary` |

### How It Works

```
Session opens
    → SessionStart hook fires
        → Claude asks: which role today?
            → Agent loads role-specific memory files
                → Works as that persona
                    → On subtask complete: auto-updates tasks.json + project_truth
                        → Next session picks up right where you left off
```

**Key design decisions:**

- **Memory isolation** — the Paper Writer can't see the Conductor's orchestrator state; the Literature Scout can't see experiment results. This prevents context pollution.
- **Shared state** — `tasks.json` and `project_truth.md` are the common ground, updated by all roles after each subtask.
- **No manual sync** — the Conductor auto-updates `tasks.json` (marks tasks `done`) and appends a progress entry to `project_truth.md` whenever a subtask completes, without waiting for you to ask.

## 34 Research Skills

Skills are structured instruction sets that Claude loads on demand. Each skill is a markdown file covering a specific research task.

<details>

## Hooks

Oh My Paper registers three hooks that run in the background:

| Hook | Trigger | What It Does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **SessionStart** | Every time you open Claude Code in this project | Outputs project context to Claude — current stage, active task, last handoff — then prompts you to pick a role via `AskUserQuestion` |
| **Stop** | When a task completes | Tracks task completion, updates `tasks.json` |
| **PostToolUse (Write)** | After any file write | Detects pipeline stage transitions |

**Important:** Hooks only activate after running `/omp:setup` in your project. Setup registers the `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json` and creates the `.pipeline/` directory that the hook checks.

---

## Research Pipeline

A structured 5-stage workflow from idea to publication:

```
┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌───────────┐
│  Survey  │ →  │ Ideation │ →  │ Experiment │ →  │ Publication │ →  │ Promotion │
└──────────┘    └──────────┘    └────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └───────────┘
```

Each stage comes with:
- **Auto-generated task trees** — what to do next
- **Recommended skills** — which skills to load
- **Context-aware prompts** — agents read `tasks.json` and `research_brief.json` and know what to do

---

## Project Scaffold

`/omp:setup` creates this structure:

```
my-research/
├── paper/                  # LaTeX workspace
│   ├── main.tex
│   ├── sections/
│   └── refs/
├── experiment/             # Experiment code & scripts
├── survey/                 # Literature survey artifacts
├── ideation/               # Ideas, evaluations, plans
├── promotion/              # Slides, demos, outreach
├── skills/                 # Project-local skills
├── .pipeline/
│   ├── tasks/
│   │   └── tasks.json      # Task tree across all stages
│   ├── docs/
│   │   └── research_brief.json
│   └── memory/             # Agent memory files
├── .claude/
│   └── settings.json       # SessionStart hook registration
├── CLAUDE.md
└── AGENTS.md
```

---

## How Memory Works

Each agent role reads and writes specific memory files. The Conductor is responsible for keeping shared state in sync.

```
.pipeline/memory/
├── project_truth.md        # Ground truth + progress log (appended after each subtask)
├── orchestrator_state.md   # Conductor's planning state
├── execution_context.md    # Current task context for executors
├── experiment_ledger.md    # Experiment history & results
├── result_summary.md       # Latest results for writing & review
├── review_log.md           # Review feedback history
├── literature_bank.md      # Organized paper notes
├── agent_handoff.md        # Cross-agent handoff messages
└── decision_log.md         # Rejected directions & reasoning

.pipeline/tasks/
└── tasks.json              # Shared task tree (all roles read/write this)
```

Memory survives across sessions. The `SessionStart` hook reads these files and injects the relevant context — you pick up right where you left off.

**Auto-sync rule:** The Conductor updates `tasks.json` and `project_truth.md` automatically after every subtask completes (delegate / experiment / survey / write / review). You never need to ask it to sync.

---

## Remote Experiments

The `remote-experiment` skill + `/omp:experiment` support a full auto-experiment loop:

```
Design plan → Implement code → rsync to server → Run on GPU → Parse metrics → Repeat
```

- SSH/rsync-based remote compute via `compute-helper` CLI
- Configurable success thresholds, max iterations, and failure limits
- Results flow back into `experiment_ledger.md` for the Paper Writer

## Philosophy

> **Enhance, don't replace.** Claude Code is already smart — we add research structure, not overrides.

- **Your context is for reasoning** — hooks inject only what's needed; memory files keep the rest on disk
- **Domain-specific, not generic** — every skill, agent, and command is designed for academic research
- **Invisible when not needed** — hooks run in the background; no noise if you're just coding
- **Composable** — use one command, use all of them, or just let the hooks do their thing
- **Memory over repetition** — agents remember project context so you don't re-explain every session

---

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you add a new skill, put it in `skills/` with proper YAML frontmatter and update `research-catalog.json`.

Any change to cached content requires version bumps in **both**:
- `plugins/oh-my-paper/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
